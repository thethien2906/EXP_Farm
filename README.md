## 🧠 Core Mechanic: Tiered EXP Calculation

EXP is calculated at the end of a session using a **tiered reward system**:

| Tier       | Duration        | Rate               |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Tier 1     | 0 - 30 minutes  | 10 EXP per second  |
| Tier 2     | 30 - 60 minutes | 20 EXP per second  |
| Tier 3     | 60+ minutes     | 30 EXP per second  |

### 🧮 Example Sessions

- **25 min** session → `1500 × 10 = 15,000 EXP`
- **45 min** session → `(1800 × 10) + (900 × 20) = 36,000 EXP`
- **2 hours** session → `(1800 × 10) + (1800 × 20) + (3600 × 30) = 162,000 EXP`

The longer you focus, the more valuable each second becomes!
